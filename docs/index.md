Welcome
============

DOME is a framework for making 2D games using the [Wren programming language](http://wren.io) which can be played across platforms.

## Design Mission
DOME has been designed to provide simple APIs for making games, so that you feel comfortable, whatever you're making.
It also aims to rely on as few dependencies as possible, easy to build on most platforms and games made with DOME should be easy to share!

## Why Wren?

Wren is a great language for making games in:
 * Wren has a simple syntax, and a small core API, so it's easy to learn and work with.
 * Dynamic typing, which makes writing code easy, for fast prototyping.
 * The language runtime is designed to be fast, which is perfect for games.
 * Wren supports functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it possible to express your ideas clearly.
 * Finally, it's fun!
